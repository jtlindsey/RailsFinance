<h1>**** revisit account.js ***</h1>
<br>
* adding {include_blank: 'Please Select'} to form (_account_form_partial) makes "type" dissapear here 
<br>
* getting excessive on spending $$$$ on this feature...will remove if not quick fix, looking like app may not be where I want it to be when I stop paying for scheduled help. This feature is eating up a lot of cost and it's still in its most basic form (no styling progress).
