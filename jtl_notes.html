carrierwave to consider if unable to get add/remove working properly:

create documents table for uploaded documents, table columns are document, and user id
transaction column named 'documents' should be changed to reference documents table/documents for user

user should be able to add multiple documents

user should be able to delete individual documents

user should be able to delete all documents

test that each condition appropriatly changes the view, database, and folders. because the last fix only removed filename in view but later discovered original files were still in folder when trying to delete individual files.
