## Personal Finance and Budgeting Software

I've been using Microsoft Money for 10+ years but it's always been a pain that it is only available on Windows OS. Now that I primary use Mac and Linux, I'd like to have something just as useful but cross platform compatible. Plus I'd like to be able to use it on mobile devices. There are many paid services that already offer this, but I wanted to make a free open source version. I'll try to update this readme as parts of the project are completed. Currently I don't have a lot of time to commit to the project, so progress may be slow.

The software will be easy to use so people of all ages...adults use to to manage their personal or family finances and children can use it to learn how to budget and save.

Id like the desktop version of this to be based on the Node.js platform and be written in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. That will be the next step after completing the Rails version. This feature list is a mix of features to be added in the web and desktop version.
